# CoBuild: The Ultimate Developer Job Board!

### Brief Description

CoBuild is a comprehensive web application for developers that serves as a robust job board. Its primary goal is to revolutionize the job application process by introducing an innovative approach to candidate assessment. CoBuild achieves this by integrating coding assessment questions and job posting descriptions, empowering users to tackle coding problems directly aligned with specific job opportunities. By providing this feature, candidates can accurately evaluate their skills, benchmark their performance against other applicants, and gain valuable insights to enhance their chances of achieving success. Additionally, CoBuild caters to recruiters by presenting a curated selection of qualified candidates who possess the ideal skills and qualifications to fulfill the specific requirements of their projects or products.

### Motivation

The motivation behind CoBuild stems from the recognition of the challenges faced by job seekers in the competitive employment landscape. Traditional job boards often lack interactivity and fail to provide meaningful feedback on candidates' technical skills. CoBuild aims to bridge this gap by combining the familiarity of job postings with the rigor of coding challenges. This unique approach helps candidates better understand the requirements of potential employers and empowers them to improve their skills accordingly.

### Contribution

We welcome contributions to CoBuild and appreciate your interest in improving the application. Here are some guidelines for contributing:

  Git Flow: CoBuild follows the Feature Branch workflow. When contributing, create a new branch for your feature or bug fix. <br>
  
  #### Branch Naming: Please use descriptive and meaningful names for your branches, summarizing the purpose of your changes. <br>
   1. Main Branch: This branch typically holds the stable and production-ready code. It is often named "main" or "master" branch, depending on the version control system being used.

   2. Developmental Branch: This branch serves as a staging area for ongoing development work. It may be named "development" or "dev" branch.

   3. Setup Branch: This branch is created for initial setup or configuration changes. It can be named "setup" or "configuration" branch.

   4. Feature Branches: These branches are created for developing new features. Each feature can have its own branch, ideally with a descriptive name reflecting the feature being worked on. For example, a feature branch for adding user authentication could be named "feature/authentication".

   5. Bug Fix Branches: Similar to feature branches, bug fix branches are created to address specific issues or bugs. These branches can be named with a prefix like "bugfix/" followed by a descriptive name or reference to the bug being fixed. For instance, a bug fix branch for resolving a login issue could be named "bugfix/login-issue".
      
  Issue Tracking: We use GitHub Issues to track bugs, feature requests, and other tasks. Please check the existing issues or create a new one before starting your work. <br>
  Pull Requests: Once you have completed your changes, submit a pull request against the main branch. Another member on the team will review the changes and provide feedback before merging. <br>

We believe that collaboration is crucial for creating the best possible product, and we look forward to your contributions to make CoBuild even better.
