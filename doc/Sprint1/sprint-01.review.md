 > _Suggestion:_ Have your review meeting a day or two before the due date. This way you will have some time to go over (and edit) this document, and all team members should have a chance to make their contribution.


## Iteration XX - Review & Retrospect

 * When: June 14
 * Where: At UTSC library

## Process - Reflection

We reviewed our iteration and reflected on the process we followed. Here are our observations:

### Decisions that turned out well
Agile Development Methodology: Adopting an agile development methodology, specifically Scrum, proved to be successful. It allowed us to have regular sprint cycles, which ensured timely delivery and effective collaboration within the team. The use of Scrum artifacts like sprint backlog and daily stand-up meetings helped us stay organized and aligned with our goals. (Refer to Scrum artifacts: Sprint Backlog, Daily Stand-up Meetings)

Collaborative Decision-Making: Emphasizing collaborative decision-making was a positive aspect of our process. We encouraged active participation from all team members, promoting a sense of ownership and accountability. By considering multiple perspectives, we were able to make informed decisions and leverage the diverse skills and expertise within the team. This approach contributed to a healthy team dynamic and improved overall outcomes.

### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped
Inadequate Time Allocation for Testing: We underestimated the time required for testing and quality assurance. As a result, we were unable to thoroughly test all the features within the given timeline. This led to some undetected issues and required additional bug fixing after the iteration. In future iterations, we need to allocate sufficient time for testing to ensure a higher level of software quality.

Lack of Documentation Focus: We did not prioritize documentation as much as we should have. While we were able to deliver functional features, the lack of comprehensive documentation made it challenging for new team members to onboard and understand the system. Moving forward, we plan to improve our documentation practices by allocating dedicated time for creating and maintaining documentation throughout the iteration.
The communication regarding the merging of branches:. We encountered a situation where some of the branches were partially incomplete before our scheduled meeting with the TA. This issue highlighted the importance of effective teamwork dynamics in version control and group programming. While we had initially planned to work on different branches simultaneously, there was a lack of clear communication and coordination regarding the status and progress of each branch. As a result, some team members were not aware that certain branches were still in an incomplete state.
### Planned changes
Based on our reflections, we have identified the following process-related changes for the next iteration:

Increased Testing Time: To address the issues faced with testing, we plan to allocate more time specifically for testing and quality assurance activities. By dedicating sufficient time to test our features thoroughly, we aim to reduce the number of post-iteration bug fixes and ensure a higher level of software stability.

Documentation Focus: We recognize the importance of documentation and its impact on the overall project. In the next iteration, we will prioritize creating comprehensive documentation alongside development tasks. This will include updating existing documentation and creating new documentation for new features, APIs, and system architecture.
Regular Stand-Up Meetings: We shall start conducting regular stand-up meetings where each team member would provide updates on their progress, any challenges they are facing, and discuss their branch's status. This would allow us to stay informed about the progress of each branch and identify any potential gaps or inconsistencies.
Peer Code Reviews: We would introduce a process of peer code reviews to validate the completeness and quality of the code before merging branches. This would help identify any missing functionality or incomplete implementations in the branches before they are integrated.



## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:

 User Registration and Login: We successfully implemented user registration and login functionality, allowing users to create accounts and securely log into the system. Link to User Registration and Login artifact

Job Posting and Application: We completed the implementation of job posting and application features, enabling recruiters to post job openings. There is also a fully developed job view where users can see current job postings and click on them for further detail.

Image Upload: We completed the backend implementation of encoding an image into bytes for users to upload to their profile.

#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

PDF and Image Upload: We have yet to complete the frontend implementation of uploading a pdf and image to a users profile.


## Meeting Highlights

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

Enhancing User Experience: We have prioritised improving the overall UX of our application. In the following iteration, we will focus on refining our interface and making the navigation more streamlined. This can be done by enhancing interactive elements to ensure a more intuitive user experience.

Effective Task Distribution: We recognized the need for better task distribution and workload balancing among team members. To address this, we will conduct a skills and preferences assessment to better understand each team member's strengths and interests. By aligning tasks with individual capabilities, we aim to improve productivity and satisfaction within the team.

Regular Progress Evaluation: Moving forward, we will implement regular progress evaluations within each sprint to monitor our progress effectively. These evaluations will allow us to identify potential risks or delays early on and take necessary actions to mitigate them. By maintaining a proactive approach to progress tracking, we can ensure timely delivery and avoid any last-minute surprises.
