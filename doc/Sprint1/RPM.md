## Release Planning Meeting
The release planning meeting was held on June 15th on Zoom. Every member of our group attended the meeting.

## Release Goals:
The main objective of this release is to develop a web application that facilitates connections between users, employers, and recruiters in the context of job postings and recruitment processes. The application aims to provide a user-friendly platform where users can create accounts, upload important documents, showcase their skills and experience, apply to job postings, attempt coding assessments, bookmark interesting opportunities, and access personalized features and information. Additionally, recruiters should be able to create job postings, assign coding assessments, track data and metrics, and manage their posted positions. The application will also include functionality for administrators to facilitate the overall recruitment process by allowing employers, recruiters, and companies to post job postings and manage their content.

## Scope:
Users should be able to:
Log in or sign up to access the platform. I can then access the dashboard where I can view relevant information. I can also look at my profile and edit it. (MIN-1, 2)
Manage my profile to personalize my job search. By adding and deleting posts, I can showcase my skills, projects, and achievements.. I can also edit my profile to provide accurate information to reflect my experiences and qualifications. (MIN-3, 4, 5)
Complete and view coding assessments for specific job postings. The goal of these assessments is to demonstrate my capabilities to employers. (MIN-8, 13)
Sort and view job postings based on my preferences they specify. This includes sorting jobs by criteria such as date, relevancy, and deadline. This will allow users to easily find opportunities that align with my skills, interests, and career goals. (MIN-6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12)

Recruiters should be able to:
Track data about my job postings, such as the number of views, click-through rate to external links, etc., so that I can measure their effectiveness. (MIN-17)
View all my job postings so that I can manage and monitor the positions I've posted. (MIN-18)
View the number of submissions and candidate details for each posting so that I can evaluate the interest and qualifications of applicants. (MIN-19)
