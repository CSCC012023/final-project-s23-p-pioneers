# CoBuild
CoBuild is an advanced software job board application that revolutionizes the recruitment process through its sophisticated recommendation systems and curated pre-processed technical software questions tailored to each job. In the software industry, interviews often involve a large pool of applicants and multiple rounds, which can be time-consuming for companies. CoBuild addresses this challenge by allowing companies to incorporate timed technical questions into their job applications, expediting the recruitment process. This distinctive feature empowers companies to identify top technical candidates using a dedicated leaderboard system that tracks solved technical questions, while also providing them with more time to focus on non-technical aspects during interviews.

From an applicant's perspective, CoBuild offers a seamless user experience by enabling users to create personalized profiles and upload relevant qualifications. This facilitates personalized job recommendations that align perfectly with their skills and expertise. Research and testimonials have revealed that many professionals in the software industry are passionate about video games. CoBuild takes inspiration from this trend, incorporating game mechanic elements to create a sense of competition similar to video games. The dedicated leaderboard for technical questions associated with a job application adds an exciting dimension, encouraging applicants to showcase their technical abilities and enhancing engagement throughout the recruitment process.

## What Does "Done" Mean
"Done" means that all necessary functionality and requirements of all user stories have been successfully implemented. From a bird's-eye perspective, this implies that, at its core functionality, users should be able to create an account and build a comprehensive profile, including uploading resumes and transcripts. Upon creating an account, users should have the ability to browse job postings on the website and apply for relevant positions. These job postings may include integrated technical questions that applicants need to complete, providing recruiters with a better understanding of the candidate's skills. Recruiters, on the other hand, should be able to create job postings and efficiently monitor them using enhanced data analytics. Lastly, as an administrator, I should have complete control over the entire website and enable recruiters to post job openings on the platform, potentially with associated technical questions.

## Highlights
During the product creation phase, our team held multiple in-person meetings to brainstorm ideas. To facilitate coordination, we scheduled dedicated team meetings after each CSCC01 lecture on Tuesdays. In the initial phase, we conducted research both online and through in-person discussions, exploring various open-source APIs, pretrained models, and general applications for inspiration. GitHub served as our primary platform for finding open-source APIs that could aid us in product development. Moving into the second phase, we met in person again to generate comprehensive application ideas. We created an idea's template in our GitHub repository and shared different application concepts we had come up with. Additionally, we refined our target audience, transitioning from a more general approach to more specialized audiences for our ideas. This led to the development of concepts such as a 'Tutor Near Me' application, a workout fitness application, a financial real estate application with a pre-trained house cost estimation model, among others.

In the final phase, we made the decision to finalize our idea and conducted a thorough comparison of our options. To narrow down our choice, we considered factors such as product usability and our own passion as computer science students. For instance, we determined that a mobile application would better suit the workout fitness idea, while the financial application required a focus on financial literacy research in addition to software development. As a result, we arrived at the decision to proceed with CoBuild as our chosen product. CoBuild offers seamless integration within the software industry, addressing the challenges often faced by software applicants during the interviewing an
d application process. From a team perspective, CoBuild provides an opportunity for all of us, as computer science students, to apply our industry knowledge and tackle the unique difficulties we have encountered throughout our studies. We decided to combine both our hobbies with video games and a personal stressor as computer science students, turning it into a project that we are all personally passionate about.
